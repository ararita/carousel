## Instructions

Step 1:
Set up a static JSON file for an image slider. Every slide should have an image path and a caption. The caption should be part of the JSON file, but won't get used in the React component.

Step 2:
Create a React component for the slider, which should be animated like in the video. Please use GSAP Draggable for the slider. The slider should work on mobile with touch as well. The images should be fetched from the paths provided in the JSON. The slider should have the following maximum dimensions: 590px x 680px and should be centered on an empty page.

Step 3:
Send us a zip or a URL, where we can see the final result.
